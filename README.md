# SoundVision

This was developed at Mango Hacks '17 held at Florida International University. 

About the project
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Andoid application is aimed towards the visually impaired. This is a camera application that captures images consantly at an interval and captures images of the surrounding. It uses Clarifai API for image classification. The resul is then converted to speech output using IBM's Text to Speech API for the user enabling them to constantly be aware of any obsticles that could be approaching their way. 

How to use it 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upon opening the app, it would open our camera application. That's all the user needs to do! 
The user can move around with the phone and the application would generate voice outputs that would basically list all objects that the user sees with the camera lens!
